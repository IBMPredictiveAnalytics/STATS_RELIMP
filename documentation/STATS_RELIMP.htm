  <h1>Relative Importance Measures for Regression</h1>This command
  calculates various relative importance measures for regression
  predictor variables

  <p><span class="runinhead">Dependent Variable</span> Select a
  scale-level dependent variable.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Forced Variables</span> Optionally
  select variables that will always be included in the regression.
  Importance measures are not calculated for these variables.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Independent Variables</span> Select
  one or more predictor variables whose importance measures should
  be calculated.</p>

  <p>Any categorical independent or forced variables are
  automatically converted to factors, and the importance measures
  for non-forced variables are reported for the entire factor.</p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Weight</span> The standard Statistics
  weight setting is not used.  Weights can be replication weights,
  heteroscedasticity weights, or inverse probability of selection
  weights.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Importance Metrics</span> Select one
  or more importance measure to be calculated.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Shapley Value</span> the incremental
  R2 for the variable averaged over all models. This is referred to
  as LMG in the output.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">First</span> The R2 for the variable
  when entered first</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Last</span> The incremental R2 when
  the variable is entered last</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Beta Sq</span> The square of the
  standardized coefficient. These values would sum to the R2 if the
  independent variables were uncorrelated.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Pratt</span> The standardized
  coefficient times the correlation</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">CAR</span> Marginal correlations after
  adjusting for correlations among the regressors.</p>

  <h2>Options</h2>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Scale relative importance measures to
  100%</span> All of the importance measures decompose the equation
  R2 into parts except for First and Last. Check this box to scale
  the importance measures to sum to 100%</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Display regressor ranks</span> Check
  this box to display a table showing the importance rank of each
  of the non-forced regressors for each importance measure</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Plot relative importance</span> Check
  this box to display a bar chart of the importance measures for
  each measure. Variable names for some bars will be omitted if
  there is insufficient space for them, but the bars are in the
  same order as the non-forced regressors. The names may be
  truncated.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Missing Values</span> Select listwise
  to delete cases with missing values or Stop to terminate the
  procedure if missing values are found.</p>

  <p>This procedure is computationally intensive and can take a
  long time if there are many independent variables.</p>

  <p>Note: Occasionally the computations may fail with an assertion
  of singularity when the regressor matrix is not actually
  singular. It may help in such a case to rescale variables with
  very large values.</p>

  <h2>Additional Features</h2>

  <p>This dialog generates syntax for the STATS RELIMP extension
  command. To display help for this command, run the following
  syntax:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">STATS RELIMP /HELP.</p>

  <p>One additional importance metric is only available in the
  non-US version of the relaimpo package which must be obtained
  from http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/groemping/relaimpo and is
  licensed for use only outside the United States. For this reason,
  this extension command has not been tested with this option. This
  option is not supported in the dialog box but can be specified in
  the MEASURE list.</p>

  <p>PMVD - the proportional marginal variance decomposition as
  proposed by Feldman It can be interpreted as a weighted average
  over orderings among regressors, with data-dependent weights</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>This command requires the R Essentials and
  the STATS RELIMP extension command. You can download these from
  the SPSS Community at www.ibm.com/developerworks/spssdevcentral.
  It also requires the R relaimpo package and at least Statistics
  Version 18. The relaimpo package will be automatically downloads
  during the command installation if possible.
